# Generalized Data Thinning Using Sufficient Statistics

This report explores generalized data thinning, a technique employing sufficient statistics to partition data into independent components while preserving information about unknown parameters. Motivated by the limitations of traditional data-splitting techniques in scenarios with small sample sizes or dependent data, this method offers a flexible alternative.  The report details the methodology, including key theorems and algorithms for constructing thinning procedures. Simulation studies demonstrate its effectiveness in regression and cross-validation settings.  Furthermore, data analysis of Japan's GDP and LGA Airline Passengers illustrates its application in changepoint detection, showcasing improved robustness compared to naive methods.
