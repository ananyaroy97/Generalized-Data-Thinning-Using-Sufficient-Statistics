# Generalized-Data-Thinning-Using-Sufficient-Statistics
This report explores generalized data thinning using sufficient statistics to improve upon traditional data-splitting. It partitions data into independent components, preserving information about unknown parameters. The methodology is detailed and its effectiveness is shown in regression, cross-validation, and changepoint detection.
